/**
 * | hexValue: This part of the expression performs a bitwise OR operation between the shifted ascii value and the decimal value of the current hexadecimal digit (hexValue). The result is a combination of the shifted ascii value and the decimal value of the new digit. The | operator sets the corresponding bits in the result to 1 if either of the operands 
 * 
 * ascii << 4: This part of the expression is a bitwise left shift operation. It takes the current value of ascii (which represents the accumulated decimal value so far) and shifts its binary representation 4 bits to the left. Shifting left by 4 bits is equivalent to multiplying by 16 because each left shift effectively moves the value one hexadecimal digit to the left.
